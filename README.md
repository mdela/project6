# project6
This is my first CRUD web app. It creates, views, updates, and deletes students and assignments.
I develoepd this app with the Django framework â€“ HTML, CSS, Python. This project demonstrates my basic and working understanding of full-stack development.
I expect to continue the development of this project. Further updates should include user login, a cleaner interface, and authentication.

Below are images that show the progress of my app.

Expect the pages for creating and making changes to Assignments to be the same.
